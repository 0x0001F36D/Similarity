### Similarity

### Intro
> This algorithm uses the Cohen's Kappa and Jaccard Index to do the fuzzy matching for two of the collections with any type, and throw back the similar percentage(from 0.0% to 100.0%).

### How To Use
```csharp

var src = "abc";
var cmp = "def";
var result = src.Diff(cmp);

```
